This repository contains two sets of codes named "Citation" and "Tree" along with their dedicated readme files. 
The "Citation" provides the machine learning codes to identify missed opportunities for direct NASS report citations in the university extension service publications.
The " Tree" provides the machine learning codes to discover the topics covered in the publication identified in two specific extension services, namely Oklahoma State and Oregon State JSON corpora.
